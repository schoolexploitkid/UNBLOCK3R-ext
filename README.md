# UNBLOCK3R-ext
Unblocks all websites. We first append a long string, and then make websites unable to be redirected to blocked pages. We also make the tab invisible.

This is based on code from Point-Blank/[swamp] and a few other exploits that will be mentioned once they are added as functionality.

## THIS IS STILL A MASSIVE WIP
